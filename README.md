## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vanilla JS](https://reactjs.org/) - branch : master
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - branch : react
-   [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - branch : svelte

### What I learned

First time using Svelte. Wanted to start on a small and easy project. Learned a lot but I will need time to understand everything and practice on a bigger project.

### Continued development

-   I will learn the basics of Vue 3 to adapt this project too.
-   Keep digging Svelte with Svelte Kit (SSR for this small challenge then Routing, etc)
